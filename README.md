> Repo created to help in my React study.

# 1. Context

Currently i am searching for new jobs and I am needing to studying some stuff to get updated. Beyond that, I've have software company in my name and I want to search new projects.
So I've decide to create a website for company / a personal web portfolio using React, because I've already know some stuff about Javascript/Typescript, and a little less about HTML/CSS. Currently I work with C and Python, but I've loved the typing system in Typescript. So, let's go with React hehe
