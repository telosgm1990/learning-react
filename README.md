# Learning React

> Repo created to help in my React study.

## 1. Context

Currently i am searching for new jobs and I am needing to studying some stuff to get updated. Beyond that, I've have software company in my name and I want to search new projects.
So I've decide to create a website for company / a personal web portfolio using React, because I've already know some stuff about Javascript/Typescript, and a little less about HTML/CSS. Currently I work with C and Python, but I've loved the typing system in Typescript. So, let's go with React hehe

To study React I've received some suggestion to follow this tutorial: https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e

## 3. Personal Notes

I am using the repo to train english also, witn no judgment, no concern about mistakes, only write. Maybe somehting like a diary, i dont know. But to put this in practice.
I like the ide to use Markdown to keep my notes, it's simple and beautiful. And somehow I imagine me like a wizard in Harry Potter taking some notes about a new spell. Anyway, I am tripping a little XD...

### 3.1. Static pages

#### 3.2. Course Introduction

- The comparison between playing an instrument and to program is so real. I have a "problem" that I wanna to learn any tech tool/language at same time I wanna to put in the "best" way. I love clean code, to organize/refactor my projects, but this is stucking some how....So I liked the idea of this kind of tutorial, and I need to practice, to learn, forgettin about optimizing, best patterns, etc...
